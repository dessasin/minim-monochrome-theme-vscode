# Minim Monochrome VSCode

### Back story of Minim Monochrome 
[Gruber Darker](https://jblevins.org/projects/emacs-color-themes/gruber-darker-theme.el.html) color theme for Emacs by Jason Blevins. A darker variant of the [Gruber Dark](https://daringfireball.net/projects/bbcolors/schemes/) theme for BBedit by John Gruber. Adapted for deftheme and extended by Alexey Kutepov a.k.a. [rexim](https://github.com/rexim). This is a port to Visual Studio Code by Karolis RiaubÅ«nas a.k.a. [Karka-Admin](https://github.com/Karka-Admin). 

**Minim Monochrome** is an enhanced version of the Gruber Darker theme to further highlight monochrome colors and improve readability. Care has been taken to remain faithful to Gruber Darker colors and readability was taken into account while adding new colors.
